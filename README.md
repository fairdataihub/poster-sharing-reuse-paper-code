# Trends, FAIR Practices, and Opportunities in Scientific Poster Sharing 

## Overview
Scientific posters are the most common forms of scholarly communication, with millions presented at conferences each year. They contain early-stage insights that, if shared beyond the conference, could accelerate scientific discovery. We investigated how posters are shared digitally and to what extent current practices align with the FAIR principles. In this study, digital sharing of posters and alignment with FAIR principles were investigated.
