# Trends, FAIR Practices, and Opportunities in Scientific Poster Sharing Paper

## About
Scientific posters are the most common forms of scholarly communication, with millions presented at conferences each year. They contain early-stage insights that, if shared beyond the conference, could accelerate scientific discovery. In this study, digital sharing of posters and alignment with FAIR principles were investigated.

## Standards followed
The overall code is structured according to the FAIR-BioRS guidelines. The Python code in the Jupyter notebook main.ipynb follows the PEP8 guidelines. Functions are documented with docstring formatted following Google's style guide. All the dependencies are documented in the environment.yml file.

## Using the Jupyter notebook

### Prerequisites
