        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>Magnetic hyperthermia using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to absorb alternating magnetic field (AMF) energy as a method of generating localized hyperthermia has been shown to be a potential cancer treatment. Many attempts have been made to increase the localization of MNPs, for example attaching antibodies recognizing tumor-specific epitopes or peptides binding receptors on tumor cells or neovasculature. Several research groups have shown reliable results using tumor homing cells as delivery cells for different therapeutics. Here we hypothesized that tumor homing cells can carry MNPs specifically to the tumor site, and tumor burden will decrease after AMF exposure<strong>.</strong> To test this hypothesis, first we loaded Fe/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>bi-magnetic NPs into neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which were previously shown to migrate towards melanoma tumors. We observed that NPCs loaded with MNPs travel to subcutaneous melanoma tumors. After AMF exposure, the targeted delivery of MNPs by the NPCs resulted in a significant decrease in tumor size. Second, Monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Ma) are known to infiltrate tumor sites, and also have phagocytic activity which can increase their uptake of MNPs. To test Mo/Ma-mediated magnetic hyperthermia we transplanted Mo/Ma loaded with MNPs into a mouse model of pancreatic peritoneal carcinomatosis. We observed that MNP-loaded Mo/Ma infiltrated pancreatic tumors and, after AMF treatment, significantly prolonged the lives of mice bearing disseminated intraperitoneal pancreatic tumors. Based on these observations we concluded that development of localized hyperthermia treatment using tumor tropic cells can be a potential therapy for cancer.</p>\n<p> </p>",

        "description": "<p>The large mystacial hairs (whiskers) of rodents support a variety of functions, ranging from social interactions to spatial navigation. Whisking behavior has previously been studied in the context of radial object localization, object detection as well as texture and shape discrimination. The role and importance of active whisker movements, their kinematics and motor-sensory coupling in such tasks is, however, still unclear. We addressed these issues in context of a novel horizontal object localization task in unrestrained, behaving rats.</p>\n<p><strong>PERFORMANCE</strong>. We trained rats in a staircase procedure to discriminate the relative horizontal location of two vertical bars, one on each side of the head. Their localization proficiency was only temporarily affected by removing selected whiskers. Differences between the average best-performances (mm, deg) were insignificant between groups of animals trained either with all (2.7, 5.1), a row (2.8, 5.3) or an arc (3, 5.7) of whiskers from onset of training. Surprisingly, leaving only a single-whisker on either side of the face neither impaired performance and animals in this group reached progressively lower thresholds with further training (1.5, 2.8). The lowest thresholds recorded across all conditions fell in the range of previous estimates of passive deflection detection thresholds of awake rats (0.5-1.63 deg; Hutson and Masterton, 1986). However, localization proficiency was permanently impaired if only a single whisker was left intact on each side from the onset of training (average best performance 4.9 mm, 9.5 deg). Thus, fine discriminations with a single whisker were highly dependent on prior exposure to the task with multiple whiskers.</p>\n<p><strong>MOTOR-SENSORY STRATEGIES</strong>. Head and whisker movements were recorded with a high-speed (500 fps) video camera and tracked offline using semi-automatic methods. Active whisker movements were ubiquitous and diverse during object localization. Movement amplitudes were lower and periods shorter in the localization task (medians 15 deg, 62 ms) compared to behavior in a simpler search task (medians 26 deg, 78 ms; p < 0.001, Wilcoxon). Across trials, whisker angle at moment of contact was well correlated with object position relative to the head (R = 0.86 +/- 0.1) and the horizontal offset between objects (R = 0.74 +/- 0.08; 4 rats). We also observed that whisker curvature was correlated, albeit weaker, to object position relative to head (R = 0.35 +/- 0.1). Thus, parameters that define both the position and shape of whiskers during object touch contribute to an objective read-out of relative object location. We observed a large variety of behaviors during object localization, suggesting that these different sensory cues are used to different extents by different animals.</p>\n<p><strong>WHISKING KINEMATICS</strong>. The apparent, volitional modulation of movement amplitudes and periods during object localization was contrasted by stereotyped kinematics across repetitions of the different movement components during rapid whisking. The average protraction trajectory was characterized by an initial, sharp rise in velocity that peaked at about 0.2 duty-cycle. This was followed by a linear reduction in velocity throughout the remainder of the protraction phase. Individual protractions, however, were less smooth and typically had more than one dominant velocity peak. In comparison, most retraction trajectories were characterized by a bell-shaped profile. During protraction, peak-velocity and movement duration increased with protraction amplitude although peak-velocity was independent of the movement duration. During retraction, peak-velocity also increased with movement duration. The distribution of protraction peak-velocities suggests that movement velocity does not saturate during protraction but rather reaches a target value which is maintained throughout protraction.</p>\n<p><strong>CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIOR</strong>. Whisk movements were altered both within and across whisks upon contact with objects. During object localization, movement amplitudes and their periods changed rapidly across subsequent cycles following initial contact with objects. On average, movement amplitudes were reduced and the timing of touch occurred progressively earlier in the protraction phase across subsequent movement cycles. These changes coincided with head movements along the horizontal axis in the direction of the objects. A fast (~10ms) within-whisk amplification of the ongoing movement was also observed when whiskers contacted objects during protraction.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>. Our results show that the rat vibrissal system has an excellent capability of discriminating horizontal object location. Discrimination thresholds can reach levels comparable to passive deflection detection thresholds, even with just a single whisker intact on either side of the face. However, optimal performance with only a single whisker requires prior exposure to the task with multiple whiskers. Parameters that describe both whisker location and shape contribute to an objective encoding of horizontal object location either relative to the head or in world-centered coordinates. Although fine kinematic features of whisker movements are highly stereotyped, timing and amplitudes of whisker movements are rapidly and continuously modified in response to object contact. These observations provide evidence of closed-loop effects in the rat vibrissal system, whereby motor behavior is continuously modified by sensory input.</p>",

National Park, 25-28 April 2012, Kudowa Zdrój, Poland</p>\n<p>Abstract:</p>\n<p>The differentiation of hygrophilous tall herb communities in the Stołowe Mts. is known sufficiently well, in spite of that only some relevés of Mulgedio-Aconitetea Hadač & Klika in Klika & Hadač 1944 were published by Pender and Macicka-Pawlik (1996) and Świerkosz et al. (2002). Due to small differences in altitude and ecological factor, only three communities can be distinguished: Geranio phaei-Urticetum dioicae Hadač et al. 1969 (Świerkosz et al. 2002), Petasitetum albi Zlatnik 1928 and Prenanthetum purpureae Bolleter 1921. In the 2011 the protection status of two latter communities from Mulgedio-Aconitetea class was studied. Collected data were used to assess the conservation status of tall herb communities and indicate the main threats causing changes in their structure and functions. An important component of global assessment of tall herb communities were: the occurrence of alien and synanthropic species, naturalness of the stream and occurrence of the complex of natural habitats in the vicinity of the stand.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rats move their head and body in order to orient their vibrissae towards areas of interest. The vibrissae are then used to scan the environment and to touch objects in a rhythmical fashion (whisking) at rates of 5-25 Hz. Neural and mechanical events, however, occur at much faster timescales. In order to infer relations between these events, such as that between object touch and spike generation, one must follow whisker movements at high temporal resolution. Here, we describe an automated tracking method for use with both freely- moving and anesthetized rats, based on ultra-fast videography and simple image processing techniques. The position of individual whiskers were described by a three-point spline, which allowed us to describe a whisker in terms of its angular position and its derivates, as well as the degree of bending and moments of object touch and release. These events were then correlated with electrophysiological signals (spikes and LFPs). In the case of anesthetized rats, whisking was elicited by electrical stimulation of the peripheral buccal branch of the facial motor nerve. We show that this method results in a negligible failure rate, and consistent pro/retraction profiles similar to those of behaving animals. Other rats were trained to position their head within a discrimination zone as part of a bilateral discrimination task. Head-movements were accurately followed using the corneal reflection, allowing whiskers to be tracked both relative to features in the immediate environment as well as in a strict head-centered coordinate system. Our method complements existing automated techniques for estimating whisker position, and is unique in its capability of tracking (i) the change in shape of the whisker, and (ii) multiple whiskers simultaneously in freely moving, whisking rats.

        "description": "<p>This poster describes our project, \"Trade-Offs and Synergies in Floodplain Management - A Historical-Ecological Approach\"</p>\n<p>Floodplains have long been favored sites for agriculture and settlement due to their fertility, flat topography, and proximity to rivers for easy transport of goods. To reduce flood risk attendant with flood plain settlement, extensive flood protection structures have been built, including elaborate networks of levees. These modifications have greatly reduced the ecological benefits that intact river-flood plain systems provide. There is increasing recognition that flood plain reconnection can restore some ecological benefits while further reducing flood risk. However, few of these promising multi-purpose projects have been implemented because we lack both practical methodologies for estimating benefits and an understanding of historical conditions likely to facilitate project success.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here, we use both historical and biophysical approaches to examine the trade-offs and synergies among the benefits of a proposed flood plain reconnection project in California.  We examine the social evolution of attitudes and views that shaped floodplain management decisions, and that led to moments of conflict and cooperation among actors with varied interests.  We also use hydraulic and population modeling to predict the effect of flood plain reconnection on key ecological benefits, flood risk, and availability of land for agriculture.  In combination, these approaches provide a novel view on how social and biological forces constrain and provide opportunities in floodplain management. This understanding could support effective implementation of multi-purpose projects.</p>",

An open source FMM</strong>—The fast multipole method (FMM) is a numerical engine used in many applications, from acoustics, electrostatics, fluid simulations, wave scattering, and more. Despite its importance, there is a lack of open community code, which arguably has affected its wider adoption. It is also a difficult algorithm to understand and to program, making availability of open-source implementations even more desirable.</p>\n<p>Headings in the brochure:</p>\n<p>- Method: multiople-based, hierarchical</p>\n<p>- Features</p>\n<p>- Performance: Strong and weak scaling</p>\n<p>- GPU relevance: Compute-bound</p>\n<p>- Applications: Electrostatics, Turbulence Simulation</p>\n<p> It folds like a z-fold brochure!  Instructions: http://autobodyconsultinggrp.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/tri-fold_brochure/</p>",

This study reconstructed HIV transmission networks and investigated patterns of epidemic growth and spread from a Europe wide dataset of 30,000 patients.</p>\n<p>We find that the reconstructed transmission graph, where vertices represent patients and edges, a transmission between them, has has assortativity coeffienct (~ 0.6) which suggests endogenous growth of the HIV epidemic in Europe. Temporal evolution of the epidemic, which is estimated from reconstructed phylogenetic trees, indicates episodic growth which probably reflects the community structure of the contact network.</p>\n<p>This poster will be presented at ECCB 2012. </p>\n<p> </p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>On April 7, 2008, the previously voluntary National Institutes of Health (NIH) publicaccess policy became mandatory, requesting that the NIH-funded principal investigators (PIs) submit to PubMed Central (PMC) immediately upon publication the peer-reviewed copy of their article, which will then become available for public access through PMC no later than after a twelve-month embargo period.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>\n<p>The questions this dissertation attempted to answer are:</p>\n<p>1. Which factors motivate the NIH-funded PIs to publish in the PLoS open-access journals?</p>\n<p>2. How do NIH-funded PIs perceive the NIH public-access policy? </p>\n<p>3. How does the NIH public-access policy influence the PIs’ publishing behavior?</p>\n<p>4. How does the NIH public-access policy influence the PIs’ decision to publish in</p>\n<p>open-access journals?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>During the period March-May 2011, fortytwo NIH-funded PIs who had published in one of the PLoS journals during the period 2005-2009 and who were affiliated with thirty-two academic institutions, research centers and hospitals around the United States were interviewed using SkypeTM software. A random sampling from the RePORTER database was used for the selection of the participants. The participants were divided into two categories; the pre-mandate, who published in PLoS journals before the mandatory policy and the post-mandate, who published for the first time in one of the PLoS journals after the policy. During the interviews, a semi-structured interview protocol was followed, in which the PIs were asked to answer thirteen open-ended questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>From the pre-mandate participants (N=42, n=15) only five PIs were self-characterized as open-access advocates. From the postmandate participants (N=42, n=27) the open-access advocates totaled fourteen. The data revealed that the vast majority of the PIs are not influenced by the NIH public-access policy in their publication preferences. Since a large number of journals comply with the terms of the policy, the PIs choose where they will publish their papers based on the journal quality, impact factor, readership, wide and fast article dissemination and quality of the work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Poster <a href=\"http://www.berlin9.org/bm~doc/pontika_berlin9.pdf\">presented</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.berlin9.org/\">Berlin9 conference</a>, Washington DC, November 9-10, 2011</p>",

        "description": "<p>Python has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community in recent years resulting in a wide range of software being written for everything from numerical computation and machine learning to spectral analysis and visualization. SunPy is a free and open-source software library for working with solar and heliospheric datasets, written in the Python programming language. It provides an alternative to the IDL-based SolarSoft (SSW) solar data analysis environment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SunPy has map objects that allow simple overplotting of data from multiple two-dimensional image FITS files; time-series objects that allow overplotting of multiple lightcurves, and integration with online services such as The Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) and The Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK). SunPy also provides functionality that is not currently available in SSW such as advanced time series manipulation routines and support for working with solar data stored using JPEG 2000. We give some examples of what can be done in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can take advantage of many different data analysis tools not readily available in SSWIDL.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We also discuss future goals for the project and ways for interested users can become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.</p>\n<p><br>(Presented at AAS SPD 2012 Meeting in Anchorage, AK)</p>",

Typically, domestic wastewater is combined and transported as a single wastestream, however, there is considerable variation in the pollutant and pathogen content of wastewater derived from different activities within the home (e.g. toilet flushing, dishwashing, bathing etc.). In Ireland, the issue of unsewered wastewater treatment systems often located in rural areas and estimated to number over 400,000, constitutes a significant diffuse risk to both surface & groundwater.</p>",

Unfortunately there is nothing complete about the process. Frequently intermediate and supplementary experimental data is excluded, methods are not nearly detailed enough, and results are manipulated for appearance. Open notebook science aims to be a complete account of the scientific process: from ideas and planning, to experimental setup and protocol design, all the way through data interpretation and commentary. Here I talk about tools to create and support an open notebook, effective use of the medium, and how social interaction creates a community using examples from my own open notebook for research and from teaching Physics 308L Junior Lab.</em></strong></p>",

        "description": "<p>Deep brain stimulation studies are underway in a wide variety of neuro-psychiatric disorders. Here we describe an exploratory study into the effect of high frequency deep brain stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. This study explores the regions activated by DBS of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus through examination of immediate early genes as markers of neuronal activation and the consequences of this activation on open-field behaviours. Stimulation was delivered bilaterally with monophasic, anodic, constant current 100us duration pulses at a frequency of 130Hz delivered at an amplitude of 200uA. Brains were removed from anaesthetised animals, sectioned and radio-labeled for the IEGs<em> zif-268</em> and <em>c-fos</em>. In anaesthetised rats DBS of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus produced robust increases in the expression of <em>zif-268</em> but not <em>c-fos</em> localised to regions that are reciprocally connected with the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, including the prelimbic and orbitofrontal cortices, and the premotor cortex indicating an increase in neural activity in these regions by a putatively antidromic mechanism.</p>",

We address this problem by using a discretization with a series of tesseroids. There is no closed formula giving the gravitational fields of the tesseroid and numerical integration methods must be used, such as the Gauss Legendre Cubature (GLC). A problem that arises is that the computation times with the tesseroids are high. Therefore, it is important to optimize the computations while maintaining the desired accuracy. This optimization was done using an adaptive computation scheme that consists of using a fixed GLC order and recursively subdividing the tesseroids. We have obtained an optimum ratio between the size of the tesseroid and its distance from the computation point. Furthermore, we show that this size-to-distance ratio is different for the gravitational attraction than for the gravity gradient tensor.</p>",

        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>Rarity in ecology, though often observed, provides a significant challenge to theoretical and empirical ecologists alike. Yenni, Adler, and Ernest (in press) proposed a theoretical mechanism explaining persistent rare species in which the population dynamic causing species to be rare (strong negative density dependence) is also what allows rare species to persist. It remains, however, to determine if ecological communities generally show the theoretical pattern, or if rare species are perhaps controlled by other dominant processes shadowing the effects of strong negative density dependence. The strength of density-dependent population dynamics was estimated using species abundance data from over 60 communities across a broad range of environments and taxonomic groups. In the majority of cases, rare species showed disproportionately strong negative density dependence. Additionally, a pattern of increasing density-dependence with decreasing relative abundance was seen in most communities, signaling the importance of this mechanism for rare species specifically.Insight into the special population dynamics of rare species will inform conservation efforts in response to climate change and other disturbance.</p>",

As this is a poster, there is little text explaining figures, but details of experiments can be found on my blog, under \"unpublished data\": <a href=\"http://www.trailofpapers.net/search/label/%22unpublished%22%20data\">http://www.trailofpapers.net/search/label/%22unpublished%22%20data</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Abstract</p>\n<p>Mitral cells in the olfactory bulb of mammals encode odors dynamically via short, phasic responses throughout the breathing cycle. Less attention has been paid to how dynamic these responses are between breaths.</p>\n<p>To look at the inter-breath dynamics of odor coding, we performed multielectrode recording from the olfactory bulb of awake (and anesthetized) head-restrained mice. We found that the odor code is not stationary, and that individual cells change their response between breaths. On the population level, we show that the first breath is different from each subsequent breath.</p>\n<p>We also looked at how odors are coded after the end of odor presentation. We found that individual cells have post-odor responses that can last for seconds. On the population level, this information contains odor- and concentration-specific information. Increasing the length of odor presentation caused longer post-odor responses. To investigate the possibility of network reverberations, we artificially stimulated the olfactory bulb of Thy1-ChR2 mice, and found that stimulation could cause persistent activity for seconds following stimulation. Finally, to show that feedback can come from higher areas, we measured the LFP in the OB of mice with the ipsilateral OB blocked, and found there was still activity.</p>",

        "description": "<p>La villa romana di San Lorenzo (Cittareale, RI), indagata tra tra il 2007 ed il 2011 nell’ambito di un progetto della British School at Rome, Università è di Perugia con la collaborazione della Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici del Lazio, è costituita un complesso con un’estensione approssimativa di 4500mq che ha rivelato fasi di occupazione tra il II secolo a.C. ed il VI secolo d.C. e sul quale sono stati costruiti una chiesa da cui l’area prende il nome e il moderno cimitero. L’impianto monumentale della villa, datato a partire dall’epoca augustea, è articolato intorno ad un peristilio nel settore settentrionale che risulta abbandonato già nel III secolo d.C. Il settore meridionale del complesso, invece, ha rivelato una lunga continuità di vita ed è caratterizzato da una serie di ambienti dotati di piccoli cortili e spazi funzionali, anche coperti, di carattere produttivo.</p>\n<p>In particolare, le fasi di occupazione tardo-antiche, tra IV e VI secolo d.C., hanno restitiuito consistenti tracce dell’esistenza di un produzione locale di ceramica comune e di lucerne, di cui è stata rinvenuta anche una matrice. Al momento si possiedono solo tracce della fornace costituite da frammenti di piano forato, purtroppo fuori contesto stratigrafico, ma gli indicatori di produzione sono evidenti.</p>\n<p>Il poster intende presentare un interessante caso di studio relativo ad un centro di produzione localizzato lungo la direttrice della via Salaria, che dimostra di avere contatti sia con l’area tiberina che con quella adriatica. In particolare, la discussione intende focalizzarsi sulla produzione di lucerne nel complesso di San Lorenzo, di cui il tipo prodominante appare quello con spalla decorata con rami di palma stilizzati e motivi a cerchio con punto (avvicinabili al tipo Bailey U).</p>",

        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides produced by cyanobacteria. They potently inhibit the eukaryotic protein phosphatase families PP1 and PP2A. They are able to display toxicity only after transporter-mediated uptake by the cell. This uptake is mediated by the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP1A2. Liver cells express OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters, which results in a pronounced liver toxicity of microcystins. However, OATP1B3 is also expressed in a significant percentage of hepatocellular carcinoma cells as well as gastrointestinal, lung, breast and colon tumors. Interestingly, compared to OATP1B1, OATP1B3 is found only in low abundance in liver cells. Thus selectivity that favors OATP1B3 over OATP1B1 should lead to a decreased hepatic clearance and toxicity, and an increased uptake in OATP1B3-expressing tumors, thus creating a therapeutic window for the respective compound.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Since many naturally occurring microcystin variants are known and many more have not been descri­bed yet, there is high potential for isolating variants with unique properties. In fact, in our initial screening of 20 microcystins, we have found four microcystin structural variants with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the low nanomolecular range and with transporter selectivity that favors OATP1B3 over OATP1B1 by a factor of more than ten. Some of these microcystin variants have not yet been described in the literature.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Many different normalization methods have been proposed in the literature, however, the majority are only applicable to experiments wherein two samples are compared to one another (comparator experiments).  Time-course DNA microarray experiments (and other serial types of experiments), wherein the arrays form a pseudo-continuum of expression, have become more common in recent years, with no concomitant discussion or development of appropriate normalization methods. We have developed a conceptually simple technique for normalizing DNA time-course data that we refer to as sequential normalization.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Treatment of CNS disease is severly restricted because of the structure called the blood-brain barrier which prevents >95 % of potentially useful drugs from entering the brain. The blood-brain barrier is formed by the brain microvascular endothelium, which has continuous tight junctions and an array of ABC-transporters that actively efflux many xenobiotics. Brain endothelium also has set of metabolite transporters, including the glucose transporter, GLUT-1, which have been exploited in different ways.</p>\n<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether 4 nm glucose-coated gold nanoparticles would selectively cross human brain endothelium. The rate of transport was compared in vitro, in primary brain endothelium, the brain endothelikal line  hCMEC/D3 and 2 non-brain endothelial cell lines. Transport was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), counting nanoparticles localizes between the basal plasma membrane of the endothelium and the basal lamina over 0 to 8 hrs. The rate of movement of movement the nanoparticles across brain endothelium was 20 - 50x paster than across non-brain endothelium. The nanoparticles crossed the endothelium by moving through cytosol, they were not seen in inter-cellular junctions or in vesicles or in nuclei of the endothelium. Nor did antibiotics that block different vesicular pathways inhibit movement. The results indicate that these nanoparticlesselectively cross brain endothelium by a biophysical process that involves movement across the apical and basal plasma membranes of the endothelium.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate that these nanoparticles could be use as a potential carrier to glial cells, we have used a newly developed 3-dimensional tissue culture system. This system includes human astrocytes in a 3D gel matrix overlaid with a brain endothelial cell monolayer (hCMEC/D3). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the nanoparticles cross the brain endothelium and migrate through the gel matrix, to become selectively localised in astrocytes (in their nuclei and cytoplasm).</p>",

For the Portuguese coastal fringe, based on geological and paleoecological data from the Santo Andre lagoon (SW Portuguese coast, 80 km south of Lisbon), an evolutionary model has been proposed which comprises a transgressive phase until the middle Holocene, followed by a forced regression, despite the continuous positive eustatic signal. However, so far no palaeobotanical proxies were included in the evolutionary models. To improve the knowledge of the present models, a 4.96m-long core (LSA4) has been collected from the permanently lagoonal flooded domain. The sedimentological analysis and 14C dating of cored material, allowed us to identify four major lithostratigraphical units, accumulated after 6.3 ka cal BP. Presently the palynological analysis focused on the lower units, before 5000 BP, namely LSA4 Unit I (bioclastic muddy peats) and LSA, base of Unit IIA (muds).</p>\n<p>The presence of Mediterranean trees (evergreen <em>Quercus</em>) and shrubs (<em>Olea</em>, <em>Pistacia</em>), in the Santo André basin during the first half of the Holocene, reflects the development of a local <em>Quercus </em>forest with Mediterranean shrubland. The vegetation reflects the development of a freshwater pond (<em>Botryococcus</em>, <em>Pediastrum</em>, <em>Nymphaea</em>, <em>Myriophyllum</em>) as a consequence of the formation of a costal barrier, but with some sea water influence as reflected by the presence of dinoflagellate cysts of <em>Spiniferites </em>and occurrence of <em>Cymatiosphaera</em>. The presented results represent a contribution, from palynological science, to the evolutionary models already proposed in the literature (and based on other proxies) in what concerns palaeoclimatological and human-induced contributions to modulate coastal responses.</p>",

Two areas that have not been explored in these models are the spatial patterns (other than SARs) and the temporal dynamics as produced by ecological succession. We explored the temporal pattern with regard to the richness (R), the Shannon diversity index (H) and with respect to spatial pattern with fractal information dimension (D<sub>1</sub>). We used a spatial explicit stochastic model where space is discretized and each position represents an individual, these kind of models have been called stochastic cellular automata or interactive particle systems. We built 4 slightly different models: a classic neutral model, a neutral model without the saturation or zero-sum assumption and a hierarchical model with and without saturation. We analyze the first 100 time steps of colonization of an empty site. Neutral models reach an equilibrium before than the hierarchical ones and no major differences were found between saturated and not saturated kinds of models. Two parameters of the models were more important in all cases: the colonization rate and the dispersal distance. Both have a positive influence in D<sub>1 </sub>, H and R. We observed in the hierarchical models a clear negative relationship between D<sub>1</sub> and H. In contrast we found in the neutral models a triangular relationship: there is a negative relationship between H and the minimum D<sub>1</sub>. This negative relationship was also found in experimental ecosystems and this implies that D<sub>1 </sub>could be used as an index to identify probable areas of high diversity.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Historical grazing patterns in the SNP have developed two distinct vegetation types – heavily grazed short grass vegetation and lightly grazed tall grass vegetation – derived from former land use which differ in vegetation quality, community composition and usage by herbivores. This poster presents some of the methods we use to study how herbivore exclusion affects ecosystem properties and processes.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Natural or synthetic cyclic peptides often possess pronounced bioactivity. Their mass spectrometric characterization is difficult due to the predominant occurrence of non-proteinogenic amino acid monomers and the complex fragmentation patterns observed. Even though several software tools for the annotation of cyclic peptide tandem mass spectra have been published, these tools are still unable to annotate a majority of the signals observed in experimentally obtained spectra. They are thus not suitable for extensive mass spectrometric characterization of these compounds. </p>\n<p>This lack of an advanced and user-friendly software tool has motivated us to extend the fragmentation module of a freely available open-source software, mMass (http://www.mmass.org), to allow for cyclic peptide tandem mass spectra annotation and interpretation. The resulting software has been tested on several cyanobacterial and other naturally occurring peptides and has been found to be superior to all other tools currently available with regard to both usability and annotation extensiveness. Thus it is highly useful for accelerating the structure confirmation and elucidation of cyclic as well as linear peptides and depsipeptides.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Este poster foi apresentado no III Congresso Brasileiro de Biologia Marinha que ocorreu de 15 a 19 de maio de 2011 em Natal (RN). O trabalho objetivou avaliar as variações espaço-temporais de assembléias de anfípodes caprelídeos associados a bancos de alga parda <em>Sargassum</em> (Fucales), no litoral norte do Estado de São Paulo. As coletas foram realizadas nos meses de dezembro de 2009 e março de 2010 em cinco praias do município de Ubatuba (Fortaleza, Lamberto, Lázaro, Perequê-Mirim e Ubatumirim) e duas do município de São Sebastião (Preta e Cigarras). Através de mergulho livre (<em>snorkeling</em>), foram coletadas dez frondes de <em>Sargassum</em> em cada praia, que posteriormente foram lavadas e tiveram os organismos removidos e identificados até o nível de espécie. Para cada local de coleta, foram obtidos a densidade média de cada espécie (dividindo-se o número de indivíduos pela biomassa seca de <em>Sargassum</em>), a riqueza de espécies e o índice de diversidade de Shannon-Wiener (H’).</p>\n<p> </p>",

We will present current work that has taken place over the past five years, which is inspired by these pillars, and present plans for future work.<br><br>The group is actively engaged in multiple open source projects that rely on and promote open standards and open data including: Avogadro (a powerful 3D molecular editor), OpenQube (a library for quantum mechanics), ChemData (a tool for large-scale chemical data analysis and visualization), Chemkit (a library for cheminformatics), MoleQueue (a HPC queue manager), and VTK (a library for scientific data visualization). The Open Chemistry project benefits greatly from the activities of the Blue Obelisk and makes use of several prominent open-source projects including Qt and MongoDB.</p>",

        "description": "<p>I investigate a population of N limit-cycle oscillators coupled on a network structure with time delays introduced by finite signal propagation speed and embedding on a ring. By numerical simulation I find that in complete graphs velocity waves arise that were unknown before. I present attempts to understand these as perturbations of the frequency-locked phase waves which are well-understood. In regular rings and small-world networks frequency synchronisation occurs with a large variety of phase patterns. While all these patterns seem to be almost equally probable in regular rings, small-world topology sometimes prefers one pattern to form for a large number of initial conditions. I propose implications of this for the creation and storage of firing patterns in the context of the temporal coding hypothesis for information processing in the brain. The presented results suggest future analysis in order to improve theoretical understanding of the new phenomena observed and to conclude the work begun here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>Rarity in ecology, though often observed, provides a significant challenge to theoretical and empirical ecologists alike. Yenni, Adler, and Ernest (in press) proposed a theoretical mechanism explaining persistent rare species in which the population dynamic causing species to be rare (strong negative density dependence) is also what allows rare species to persist. It remains, however, to determine if ecological communities generally show the theoretical pattern, or if rare species are perhaps controlled by other dominant processes shadowing the effects of strong negative density dependence. The strength of density-dependent population dynamics was estimated using species abundance data from over 60 communities across a broad range of environments and taxonomic groups. In the majority of cases, rare species showed disproportionately strong negative density dependence. Additionally, a pattern of increasing density-dependence with decreasing relative abundance was seen in most communities, signaling the importance of this mechanism for rare species specifically.Insight into the special population dynamics of rare species will inform conservation efforts in response to climate change and other disturbance.</p>",

Such changes have potential implications for ecosystem nutrient cycling (e.g. C storage).</p>\n<p><em>This poster was presented at the British Ecological Society 2012 Annual Meeting in Birmingham between the 17th and 20th December.</em></p>",

It is also a difficult algorithm to understand and to program, making availability of open-source implementations even more desirable.</p>\n<p>ExaFMM is an open-source code base to utilize fast multipole algorithms, in parallel, and with GPU capability. The name reflects our viewpoint of the fast multipole method (FMM) as a rising star in the development of high-performance computing towards Exascale.</p></div>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Background:</strong> Whilst antipsychotic drugs treat the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia they have limited effects against the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Here a deep brain stimulation (DBS) strategy analogous to that used in Parkinson's disease is proposed. Methods for the validation of this strategy in a phencyclidine (PCP) rat model of schizophrenia are described. Given the weight of evidence implicating disruption of the thalamo-cortical system, particularly the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), studies have focussed on investigation of the consequences of high frequency stimulation of the MD. Results are reported in terms of spectral analysis of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) and the expression of the immediate early genes (IEGs) zif-268 and c-fos.</p>\n<p><strong>Methods:</strong> In the study concerning the expression of IEGs, custom made bipolar stimulating electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the MD of isoflurane anaesthetised rats. Stimulation was delivered unilaterally to either the right or left MD whilst the contralateral hemisphere served as a control. High frequency stimulation stimulation (Frequency, 130 Hz; Amplitude, 200 μA; Pulse Width, 100 μs) was delivered for 3 hours via a custom designed and made deep brain stimulation device. Brains were then removed, sectioned and radio labelled for the immediate early genes zif-268 and c-fos before being exposed to X-ray film for 8 days. The relative optical density of the resultant autoradiograms were analysed with MCID, a computer based optical densitometer. In the study concerning the spectral analysis of the ECoG, custom made bipolar stimulating electrodes were implanted unilaterally into the left MD of rats treated sub-chronically with PCP (2.6 mg/kg for 5 days, 3 day washout) or saline. Animals were anaesthetised with isoflurane and 7 screw electrodes were implanted in the skull overlying the cortex of the left hemisphere and one in the skull overlying the cerebellum. Differential ECoG recordings were made between the 7 cortical electrodes and the cerebellar electrode. Baseline ECoG recordings were made for 30 minutes before delivering high frequency stimulation (Frequency, 130 Hz; Amplitude, 200 μA; Pulse Width, 100 μs) for 1 hour via a custom designed and made deep brain stimulation device. A bipolar montage was derived by subtracting the signals from adjacent electrodes. The power spectra of the derived signals was computed using Fourier methods and the absolute band power computed for the delta (1-4 Hz) and theta bands (4-8 Hz). In addition the coherence between electrodes was computed in the delta and theta bands.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong> In isoflurane anaesthetised rats DBS of the MD produced robust increases in the expression of zif-268 but not c-fos localised to the efferent targets of the MD, indicating an increase in neural activity in the PFC. Increases in frontal delta power and parietal theta power were demonstrated in PCP treated animals when compared with saline treated controls. Furthermore PCP treated animals exhibited increased delta coherence at frontal electrode locations and reduced theta coherence at parietal/somatosensory electrode locations. High frequency stimulation of the MD yields transient increases in delta and theta power at frontal electrode locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Impairment in the ability to recruit the prefrontal cortex is frequently reported in schizophrenia. The results of these experiments demonstrate activation of frontal cortical regions as a consequence of deep brain stimulation of the MD. Furthermore quantitative analysis of the ECoG demonstrates a spectral profile, in rats treated sub-chronically with PCP, similar to that seen in schizophrenic patients.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Short linear motifs in proteins of 3-8 residues in length play key roles in protein-protein interactions, frequently binding specifically to peptide-binding domains within interacting proteins. These may provide novel drug targets for peptides or small molecules. However, their tendency to be found in disordered segments of proteins has meant that they have often been overlooked. Here, we present SLiMPred (Short Linear Motif Predictor) [1], the first general de novo method to computationally predict such regions in proteins. This is based on ensembles of bidirectional recurrent neural networks, trained in five-fold cross-validation on a non-redundant protein dataset containing known motif instances from the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM)<br>database.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> It is possible to distinguish genomic information based on unzipping DNA with optical tweezers. This is due to the fact that the force signature for unzipping single DNA molecules is sequence-dependent<br>and easily modeled. We can use this information to match an unzipped sequence to a library of sequences obtained through simulations. We call this technique shotgun DNA mapping and have found that we can use it to better understand protein-DNA interactions and the interaction locations. We currently are pursuing applications in chromatin mapping and structural DNA mapping with many future possible ventures.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Until recently, <em>Melipona rufiventris</em> was included in the list of endangered species of the fauna of Minas Gerais. Several factors have contributed to the reduction of populations of these bees, with emphasis on deforestation and fragmentation with consequent loss of natural habitats. The present study aimed to evaluate the genetic variation and relationship of thirteen nests of <em>Melipona rufiventris</em> from three natural areas of Cerrado in Minas Gerais, in the towns of Araguari-MG, Córrego-Danta-MG and Guimarânia-MG. The genetic parameters were evaluated based on seven microsatellite loci using heterologous primers developed for <em>Melipona bicolor</em>, and the analysis involved five workers per nest. The results showed twelve distinct alleles, with sizes ranging from 87 to 198 bp, and low levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity. Further analyzes involving homoespecifics primers or more microsatellite loci with heterologous primers should prove more conclusively whether the high genetic similarity among the thirteen nests may be playing or not a low genetic diversity of the species in the studied areas.</p>",

        "description": "<p>We here present an approach to address the problem of aggregating all knowledge supporting or contradicting biological pathways. With the increasing accuracy and high-throughput aspects of nowadays biological experimental research, the amount of data for known pathways is exploding. However, it is hard to match past knowledge on pathways against these new data and insights.</p>\n<p>Pathways, like signalling, metabolic, and transcription pathways, are abstractions of biological interactions. They provide a way to present large quantities of knowledge in a concise manner. The curation of pathways involves the integration of biological data from pluriform set of different knowledge source, such as databases, the literature or crowd mined expert knowledge. Current pathway approaches require large curation teams browsing through many websites. Whether it is PubMed, Uniprot, or any other relevant resource. Because most of the data is already in electronic form, data aggregation should be feasible. The different website layout are not helping, but many resources do come with a so-called application program interface (API), which allow access to the data. </p>\n<p>We demonstrate how existing pathway knowledge can be complemented with those further resources. </p>\n<p>For this, we use PathVisio (<a href=\"http://www.pathvisio.org/\">http://www.pathvisio.org/</a>), which is an extensive desktop pathway editor and pathway analysis tool. As an analysis tool it allows the projection of experimental data on pathways. PathVisio shares a both an open source codebase and a native format (GPML) with WikiPathways (<a href=\"http://www.wikipathways.org/\">http://www.wikipathways.org/</a>). WikiPathways is an open resource for biological signalling, pathway, and regulation pathways. It is working based on the same principles as Wikipedia where the community as a whole provides the knowledge. WikiPathways contains more than 2000 pathways covering 26 species. WikiPathways shares an open source codebase and its native format GPML with WikiPathways (http://www.wikipathways.org). Where WikiPathways requires a lean code base for optimized online performance, PathVisio being run as a desktop application, allows more complex algorithms and libraries to be included. This also enables the development of various plug-ins. <br>We have developed a plug-in called PathVisio Loom, which provides a framework for knowledge aggregation through menu guided additions. It allows the integration of biological knowledge available in the different formats (e.g. text mining data, interaction data available through webservices, Semantic Web Data or structure interaction data from local files). Starting from a single pathway object, after clicking the curator is given a set of known interactions aggregated from different online resources to select those relevant to the pathway under scrutiny. </p>\n<p><strong>With Pathvisio Loom, pathway knowledge integration transforms from a mainly manually  editing process to a more click-and-grow process.</strong></p>",

        "description": "<p>Most mammalian sensory systems process information collected through actively generated movements. The rodent vibrissal system is one such system, whereby specialized facial musculature enables fine control of whisker movement. Sensory events that occur upon whisker-object contact are encoded in the activity of primary afferents in the trigeminal system. These afferents exhibit selectivity for direction, velocity, acceleration and temporal frequency. Not much is known about how whisker behavior generates contact-parameters appropriate for reliable detection by sensory afferents. Studies in actively sensing rats demonstrate that neuronal activity is significantly influenced by motor activation. Here, we summarize results from two studies aimed at understanding how whisking behavior is involved in various aspects of sensory processing, such as spatial localization</p>",

        "description": "<p>The relative simplicity of the rodent vibrissal system facilitates a systematic study of motor control and sensorimotor loop dynamics. Multiple anatomical loops contribute to active control of the vibrissal plant during explorative behavior. We have examined motor control during exploratory and task-related whisking in rats and mice. Using high-speed video we monitored whisker trajectories and extracted various kinematic parameters from the whisker motion. We analyzed repetitive whisker movements with a forward (protraction) and a backward (retraction) phase. We found that, across tasks, the protraction phase during high-amplitude whisks is characterized by a pulsatile forward motion with relatively constant velocity. The amplitude of protraction is governed primarily by the duration of movement whereas retraction amplitude scales primarily with velocity. During protraction, object touch is followed by a rapid (~10 ms) active thrust of the ongoing movement, typically observed as an increase in whisker velocity. These observations are consistent with the notion that the protraction phase acts as the sensory acquisition stage during whisking and that rapid brain loops can process and adjust pre-planned movement trajectories in the behaving rodent.</p>",

First,\nPLA is dissolved in a volatile organic solvent (DCM) and this solution is\nemulsified in an aqueous surfactant solution. In the next stage, the\nresultant droplets are solidified by evaporation of solvent. Porous PLA\nparticles can be produced via W/O/W emulsion route, where first, an\ninner water phase is dispersed in a mixture of PLA and DCM in the\npresence of oil-soluble surfactant form a W/O emulsion. This emulsion is\nthen dispersed drop-wise into an aqueous surfactant solution to form a\nW/O/W emulsion. W/O particles are formed by evaporation of DCM.",

        "description": "<p>We propose a method for the creation of an anatomically and mechanically realistic brain phantom from polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) for validation of image processing methods for segmentation, reconstruction, registration, and denoising. PVA-C is material widely used in medical imaging phantoms for its mechanical similarities to soft tissues. The phantom was cast in a mold designed using the left hemiphere of the Colin27 brain dataset [Holmes et al. 1998] and contains deep sulci, a complete insular region, and an anatomically accurate left ventricle. Marker spheres and inflatable catheters were also implanted to enable good registration and simulate tissue deformation, respectively. The phantom was designed for triple modality imaging, giving good contrast images in computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Multimodal data acquired from this phantom are made freely available to the image processing community (http://pvabrain.inria.fr) and will aid in the validation and further development of medical image processing techniques.</p>",

In the process, we have accumulated a vast variety of research including some “gray” materials such as faculty papers and final drafts. We have also claimed our success because a few related studies have been quoted, for instance, by some theses. Finally, 83% of users embraced Creative Commons License to post research. Users of MyOpenArchive therefor understand the usefulness of the digital right management. Besides, CC BY-NC [10] has been embraced by 50% of the posts. These results reveal increasing public awareness of the importance of a medium for sharing academic studies.</p>",

It offers a plugin architecture and it has a very active community both of developers and users. SemScape is developed as plugin for the latest version of Cytoscape, 3.0, which is released in beta at the time of this writing and presents a completely new architecture from previous versions. SemScape offers a range of functionalities, which are derived from what was implemented in RDFScape [2] and AGUIA [3]. However this system provides a newer, more efif cient and up to date implementation.</p>\n<p> </p>",

        "description": "<p>The relative locations of the STEREO, SOHO, SDO and Venus Express spacecraft in August 2010 provide an opportunity for unique multi-spacecraft observations of two CMEs originating from the same solar source region. On 7 August 2010, a halo CME originating from NOAA AR11093 is observed remotely by STEREO B. Seven days later this active region erupts again, and a halo CME is observed remotely by STEREO A on 14 August 2010. </p>\n<p>We show that both eruptions are associated with reverse S-shaped flux rope structures and display a number of typical large-scale features relating to CMEs, including coronal dimmings and EUV waves. By combining remote sensing and in situ observations of the ejecta, we consider the structure and heliospheric evolution of these CMEs and their interplanetary counterparts.</p>\n<p>Our estimate of the dimensionless expansion rate of the 14 August 2010 magnetic cloud suggests that this structure may be perturbed by a high speed stream, likely to originate from a coronal hole. Consequently, we address the influence of the surrounding solar wind on the in situ observations of both ICMEs. Additionally, a comparison of the orientations of the axes of the erupting flux ropes near the Sun and in interplanetary space reveals that both CMEs appear to undergo significant rotation as they expand into the heliosphere.</p>\n<p>We compare and contrast many aspects of these two eruptions from a remote sensing and in situ perspective, before discussing the evolutionary implications of the similarities and differences between the ejecta.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Stabilizing mechanisms of coexistence, by definition, cause a species to experience greater intraspecific competition than interspecific. This results in negative frequency-dependent growth rates for that species causing a negative relationship between its relative frequency in the community and its growth rate in the next year. The most crucial aspect of this negative relationship for persistence is that it enables a species to increase when rare. This has been empirically demonstrated for pairwise interactions. However, in species-rich communities, the effects of competition are not realistically pairwise. In cases where multiple species are competing for a resource, stabilizing mechanisms become increasingly important to ease the effects of that competition. Thus,  for rare species, increasing the strength of stabilization may be essential to their persistence in the community, or their ability to invade. A mathematical model of negative frequency-dependent growth is used to explore how the strength of stabilization affects a species’ ability to persist in a community. Increasing the steepness of the negative frequency-dependent growth relationship for rare species significantly increases their mean time to extinction in this simulated community. Significantly, the desert rodent community at the Portal LTREB site shows this predicted pattern, in which rare species experience stronger negative frequency-dependant growth relationships than the dominant species. This pattern may be a characteristic of species-rich communities, and thus have implications for the ability of those communities to maintain stable structure despite change (climate change, invasive species, habitat loss).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Primary vibrissal afferents terminate in the brainstem trigeminal complex, from which multiple ascending projections relay sensory information to targets in the mesencephalon and diencephalon. It is also known that the trigeminal nuclei are extensively interconnected and additionally receive descending inputs from sensory and motor cortex. These anatomical connections place the trigeminal complex within a web of closed-loop networks. It remains an unresolved issue how ascending and descending inputs combine in the trigeminal complex of awake, behaving animals. Here, we report initial steps in elucidating the role of cortical inputs in early sensory processing. We recorded the extracellular activity of putative local-circuit and projection neurons in the whisker responsive region of the trigeminal interpolaris nucleus (SpVi) of awake, head-restrained mice. Spontaneous, self-generated whisker movements (5 – 8 Hz) were monitored with high-speed video (800 frames/sec), then tracked and correlated with neural activity. Compared to baseline activity when whisker were at rest the majority of cells (90%) increased their firing rates in response to whisker movements. We found no significant difference in firing rate in response to rhythmic versus non-rhythmic movements. During rhythmic motor activity, the activity of about one-third of the movement-responsive cells in SpVi was significantly modulated by the protraction-retraction phase in a uni-modal manner (P < 0.001; KS-test). Across all recorded cells, we found no population bias of the preferred phase. The modulation of unit activity in SpVi was further explored by optical stimulation of layer 5b neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) expressing the light-gated, ionotropic Channelrhodopsin-2 channel. Response latencies of layer 5b neurons to LED stimulation was 12.4 ± 1.2 ms, comparable to other studies. Consistent with results in rats (Furuta et al, 2010, J Neurosci) we found a subset of neurons in SpVi that also responded to S1 activation. Response latencies in SpVi ranged from 20 – 25 ms. Considering typical S1 response latencies to whisker deflections, we propose that S1 can modulate SpVi activity within the same or next whisking cycle following a tactile event. Our results suggest that SpVi neurons transmit information about whisker kinematics, in addition to contact related events.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Offaly, Ireland in 2010 to study solar radio bursts and the response of the Earth's ionosphere and geomagnetic field. To date, three Compound Astronomical Low-cost Low-frequency Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (CALLISTO) spectrometers have been installed, with the capability of observing in the frequency range 10-870 MHz. The receivers are fed simultaneously by biconical and log-periodic antennas. RSTO is optimized to record dynamic spectra of Type II, III and IV radio bursts. In particular, fine-scale structure such as herringbones and Type II band splitting can be detected by RSTO. Here we describe RSTO instrumentation and present some example-spectra.</p>\n<p> </p>",

        "description": "<p>This is a poster I presented at the 2012 Gordon Conference Metabolic Basis of Ecology.</p>\n<p>Abstract</p>\n<p>The spatial structure of ecologica­l communities contains the signature of community assembly; however, ecologists have struggled to make quantitative links between ecological processes and spatial patterns. The recent development of the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) provides one theoretical framework for unifying community patterns through four state variables: number of species, number of individuals, total energy use, and total area.  The METE can be thought of as a null theory of ecology because it ignores specific ecological processes and instead predicts that ecological patterns should be characterized by the simplest statistical model that maintains empirically observed constraints on the state variables.  We developed and tested the spatially explicit predictions of METE using the species-area and distance-decay relationships across a diverse set of plant communities.  For the majority of the datasets we considered, METE was able to accurately characterize the empirical species-area relationship; however, the theory was only successful in capturing the functional form of the empirical distance-decay relationship.  In general, METE predicted greater than observed patterns of intraspecific spatial aggregation which resulted in larger intercepts and steeper distance decay curves than observed empirically.  The METE represents a powerful statistical theory of ecological communities that yields surprisingly accurate spatial predictions given that it completely ignores specific ecological and evolutionary processes. Furthermore the success of METE suggests that understanding the drivers of the state variables, which determine the METE prediction, will provide a fruitful avenue towards a more general and unified understanding of ecological communities.</p>",

Endogenous selection is typically seen as the primary source of<br>selection hybrid zones. These hybrids zones are thought to represent tension zones where<br>reduce hybrid fitness is balanced by dispersal by parental taxa. Theory suggests that tension<br>zones are not static and tend to move and often become trapped in regions of low abundance. These areas of low abundance are often associated with environmental gradients. Two subspecies of willow warblers (<em>Phylloscopus trochilus trochilus</em> and <em>P. t. acredula</em>) in central Sweden are a good example of a narrow hybrid zone that likely resulted from secondary contact and is hypothesized to represent a tension zone. Whereas these two subspecies meet along a north-south gradient, the landscape surrounding the willow warbler hybrid zone is characterized by a perpendicular gradient in climate and habitats. In this study, we set out to use this hybrid zone combined with a long-term nationwide monitoring dataset, the Swedish Breeding Bird Survey, to test hypotheses and predictions derived from the tension zone model. Specifically, we tested (i) whether the willow warbler hybrid zone was associated with a region of low abundance, (ii) whether the hybrid zone was coincident with an environmental gradient indicative of exogenous selection, and (iii) if the single locus tension zone model could be used to predict hybrid zone abundance, supporting endogenous selection. Our results demonstrate that low abundance occurs in the willow warbler hybrid zone that is oriented on a north-south latitudinal gradient, and coincides with four previously described willow warbler trait clines. The elevation, climatic patterns, and the associated habitats for this region exist in an east-west longitudinal gradient, perpendicular to the cline in abundance, suggesting a limited role of exogenous factors in the location and maintenance of our tension zone. Further, the overall abundance of willow warblers in the hybrid zone closely matches the predicted abundance expected from the reduced hybrid fitness calculated from the single locus tension zone model.</p>",

This literature, initiated by Hamilton and later supplemented by Williams, Medawar and Kirkwood, all have unitary (non-modular) organisms in mind. These authors tend to predict that, after the age of maturity, survival will decline alongside reproductive output. Using data derived from the COMPADRE (COMparative Plant & Algae Demographic REsearch) database, we examine age-specific survival and reproduction trajectories for over 300 plant species using a matrix modeling approach. We demonstrate the existence of an astonishing variety of demographic trajectories, the majority of which do not adhere to the ‘classical’ Hamiltonian predictions of inevitable senescence. We argue that environmental filtering and phylogenetic ancestry explains much of the observed variation, and that the ‘classical’ theories of senescence are <a></a>not sufficient to explain demographic trajectories in non-unitary organisms.</p>",

Traditionally, palynological study has been used to reconstruct both terrestrial and oceanic palaeoenvironments. Here we use both pollen and dinocyst analysis to aid in understanding depositional mechanisms. We have dated and examined an 88 cm long sediment core from the tectonically active and cyclone prone Chabahar Bay area (southern Iran) where we tested the traditional methods for identifying abrupt events (grain-size & geochemistry), which we supplemented with the novelpalynologicalapproach.Both sedimentological and palynological approaches suggested a large event which we dated just prior to AD 1808, whereas geochemical approaches failed to identify the presence of any abrupt event. Although sedimentology identified the event, it was unable to inform on the depositional mechanism. The pollen and dinocyst assemblages over the event provide evidence for a large previously undocumented flood just prior to AD 1808 on the southern Iranian coastline. Our study demonstrates the utility of the palynologicalapproachinidentifyingand understanding the causes of abrupt marine events overmoretraditionalsedimentologicaland geochemical approaches.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients with treatment refactory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Stimulation of this region has also demonstrated benefit in patients with treatment resistant depression and has been proposed for the treatment of the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Despite its increasing application in the clinic, the mechanism by which DBS of the nucleus accumbens affects its therapeutic benefit remains poorly understood. Using combined stimulation and recording techniques, we examined how 24 hours of DBS affected rhythmic brain activity in freely moving rats. Local field potential (LFP) recording electrodes were fabricated and implanted, bilaterally, into the orbitofrontal cortex, prelimbic cortex, mediodorsal thalamus, and ventral subiculum. Bipolar concentric stimulating electrodes were fabricated and implanted, bilaterally, into the nucleus accumbens - one pole was used to record the LFP in the post stimulation period. Following recovery, rats were stimulated with square, monophasic, constant current 90µs duration pulses at a frequency of 130Hz delivered at an amplitude of 90µA using a custom made stimulation device. LFPs were recorded from all regions, both ipsilateral and contralateral to stimulation, before and immediately after stimulation. LFPs were collected from animals in their home cages following short-term (1 and 3 hours) and extended (24 and 48 hours) DBS.<br>Signals were processed to remove movement artifacts and analyzed to determine stimulation-induced changes in spectral power within regions, and coherence between regions.<br>Increases in spectral power, particularly in high frequency bandwidths (beta and gamma), were found in both the orbital and prelimbic cortices both ipsilateral and contralateral to stimulation. The magnitude of these increases was greater after long-term DBS compared to short-term stimulation. In addition a significant increase was seen in the gamma band in the nucleus accumbens contralateral to the stimulation site, whereas no such increase was seen in the stimulated accumbens. These findings support and extend previous reports from this lab implicating activation of the frontal cortices as a consequence of stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. In awake animals this activation is seen in higher bandwidths. Furthermore unilateral stimulation of the accumbens is seen to significantly modulate LFPs in the contralateral accumbens. These data further support the contention that DBS induces active changes in brain circuits rather than replicating a lesion.</p>",

In today's interconnected world, scientists can publish in nearly real time in a variety of means using a slew of di\u001eering technologies. The open access principle has snowballed its way into many labs, providing a new found accessibility to students, principle investigators, and even media outlets that could not have been possible with previous standards. Google's mainstream domination has pushed a thirst for information and knowledge that current and future scientists have ingested and regurgitated. This poster will highlight some of the most popular Web 2.0/Science 2.0 technologies and how they can be used to provide information to the masses.</p>",

        "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>Rarity in ecology, though often observed, provides a significant challenge to theoretical and empirical ecologists alike. Yenni, Adler, and Ernest (in press) proposed a theoretical mechanism explaining persistent rare species in which the population dynamic causing species to be rare (strong negative density dependence) is also what allows rare species to persist. It remains, however, to determine if ecological communities generally show the theoretical pattern, or if rare species are perhaps controlled by other dominant processes shadowing the effects of strong negative density dependence. The strength of density-dependent population dynamics was estimated using species abundance data from over 60 communities across a broad range of environments and taxonomic groups. In the majority of cases, rare species showed disproportionately strong negative density dependence. Additionally, a pattern of increasing density-dependence with decreasing relative abundance was seen in most communities, signaling the importance of this mechanism for rare species specifically.Insight into the special population dynamics of rare species will inform conservation efforts in response to climate change and other disturbance.</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Poster presentation at the 5th IBS conference, 7‐11.01.2011, Irakleion, Crete, Greece</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>\n<p>Identifying the causal factors that determine species’ range limits is a topic of much interest. We investigated how abiotic factors and biotic interactions affect range limits and co-existence of two closely related damselfly species, <em>Calopteryx splendens</em> and <em>C. virgo</em>. Using spatial modelling, we identified (i) environmental habitat characteristics, amount of niche overlap and degree of specialisation, (ii) combined and interactive effects of environment and predators and (iii) ecological differences between allopatric and sympatric populations. Our models identified temperature and precipitation as key environmental factors limiting the range, and showed that the overall niche overlap was wide, with <em>C. virgo</em> being more generalised, although some interspecific differences were identified. At a local level, avian predator abundance and abiotic factors exhibited stronger effects on <em>C. splendens</em>, and sympatric and allopatric populations largely overlapped. Together it appears that climate is a key factor limiting the overall geographic distribution of this species pair, and the relatively large niche overlap indicates that ecological divergence in other variables is low. This is consistent with the general suggestion that speciation in odonates is predominantly driven by sexual selection, while ecological divergence occurs secondarily. Our study highlights and corroborates previous findings that ectotherms are highly sensitive to ongoing environmental change.</p>",

For example, “why do some animals live a long time, while others live only a short time?”, and, “to what extent do closely related species share mortality and fecundity patterns?”. One approach to address these kinds of questions is to collect mortality data from different species species, to characterise their mortality trajectories using survival/mortality models fitted to the data, to extract the descriptive parameters from these models, and then to conduct phylogenetic analyses that use these parameter estimates as traits. </p>\n<p>High-quality individual-based data on mortality are relatively rare, and such data sets are phylogenetically clustered. Instead, it is more common to find life table data that, in their most basic form, follow cohorts and simply record the number of individuals remaining alive at each time step. Hundreds of published life tables exist and these represent a potentially rich and tempting resource. However, the data are of varying quality and we do not know how much confidence we can have in estimates derived from them. For example, there is considerable variation in sample size, sampling intensity, and environmental heterogeneity between life tables from different species... </p>",

        "description": "<p>The function of adult neurogenesis remains unclear. While many tools for manipulating neurogenesis have been developed for mice, there are fewer tools for rats. Radiological and chemical strategies have been used to inhibit adult neurogenesis in rats but these methods may also have undesired side effects. Since rats have a larger brain and can perform complex behaviors, it would be useful to have additional rat models for studying neurogenesis. To address this gap we therefore developed a transgenic GFAP-TK rat in which adult neurogenesis can be specifically inhibited. Preliminary results suggest that, as in mice, reduced adult neurogenesis leads to anhedonia.</p>",

University of Granada. Spain</p>\n<p>We explore whether changes in cladoceran and diatom community can be linked to changes in mean temperature and in the NAO index. A high NAO index is associated to drier conditions over southern Europe and yields dust transport from Sahara desert over the western Mediterranean basin during summer. <em>Daphnia pulicaria </em>relative abundance shows an important increase in the lake during the last decades, mainly from 1970, whereas <em>Alona quadrangularis </em>increase occurs from late 80s simultaneously with the decrease of <em>Chydorus sphaericus</em>. <em>Daphnia </em>relative abundance through the core is positively correlated to the NAO index but no with temperature values. The opposite is found for <em>A. quadrangularis </em>and <em>C. sphaericus</em>. The most abundant diatom species and the factor 1 of the principal component analysis performed on diatom assemblage are correlated to temperature values and do not show any relationship with NAO index. A positive correlation between <em>Daphnia </em>and the NAO index is also found for 10 years of <em>Daphnia </em>sampling in Río Seco Lake (1996-98 and 2005- 2011).</p>\n<p>We hypothesized that <em>D. pulicaria </em>is probably benefited by Saharan dust calcium, because this species is likely limited by Ca in Río Seco Lake and Saharan dust is rich in Ca, whereas other cladoceran and the diatom species are more affected by temperature changes in the lake region.</p>",

The app has a magazine-like interface, and server-side infrastructure for hosting chemistry-related data as well as value added services. The project is open to participation from anyone and provides the ability for users to make annotations and assertions, thereby contributing to the collective value of the data to the engaged community. The infrastructure for the app is currently based upon the Twitter API and uses Google Alerts RSS feeds as a useful proof of concept for a real time source of publicly generated content. </p>\n<p>We now highlight how ODDT can be used as an electronic notebook to share new scientific data on malaria and engage this research community by following #malaria using Twitter and Google Alerts. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Schizophrenia affects 1% of the population ranking as the ninth most prevalent cause of disability worldwide. Whilst effective pharmacological treatments exist for the positive symptoms associated with this disease the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits remain untreated. Here we propose a deep brain stimulation (DBS) strategy analogous to that used to great success in Parkinson's disease and describe methods for validation of this strategy in a rodent model of schizophrenia (Cochran et al. 2003; Neuropsychopharmacol. 28: 265-275; Pratt et al. 2008; Brit. J. Pharmacol. 153: S465-S470). Bipolar electrodes were fabricated by affixing pairs of 25µm, teflon insulated, nichrome wire to a supporting 100µm, stainless steel insect pin. These were implanted, bilaterally, into the medial-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus or the ventral pallidum of anaesthetised male Hooded Lister rats. High frequency stimulation (130Hz, 220µA, 100µs) was delivered unilaterally via a remotely controlled custom built DBS device whilst the “silent”, contralateral electrode served as a control. Cortical electrodes were fabricated by soldering wires to anchor screws and affixed to the skull above the prelimbic cortex (PrL) and referenced to an electrode implanted above the cerebellum. EEG recordings were taken throughout. Brains were removed and 20µm coronal sections were radio labelled for the immediate early genes (IEG) c-fos and zif-268 via hybridisation with a 45-mer oligonucleotide probe labelled with 33P-dATP overnight. The labelled sections were exposed to film for several days and a semi-quantitative comparison between the stimulated and control hemispheres was made by examination of the optical density of the resultant autoradiograms. Signals were processed to remove the stimulation artifact and noise and analysed to determine changes in delta and gamma power. This approach demonstrates our ability to explore DBS as a potential therapy for the cognitive dysfunction associated with the hypofrontality (reduced blood flow and metabolism in the prefrontal cortex) seen in schizophrenia. By analysis of changes in IEG and EEG activity we are able to identify the neural signatures evoked by DBS of various subcortical nuclei.</p>",

Here, we examine the adaptive aspects of whisking behavior across a range of sensory and task conditions. Whisking is constrained by a dependency between motion parameters, as well as by sensory events and task requirements. Principally, we find that these constraints act differently on whisking amplitude and frequency, supported by a recent finding that these kinematic parameters appear to be controlled by different neural systems.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Most sensory systems process information collected through actively generated movements. The rodent vibrissal system is one such system, whereby specialized facial musculature enables fine control of whisker movement. Sensory events upon whisker-object contact are encoded in the activity of primary afferents of the trigeminal system. These afferents are tuned to features of whisker deflection, such as direction, velocity, acceleration and temporal frequency. Little is known about how rats optimize whisker movements in order to maximise the information contained in afferent activity. Here, we review a number of behavioral and physiological studies that identify primary motor strategies and the neuronal variables that are likely optimized for reliable encoding of object location.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Biomedical knowledge is growing exponentially; however, meta-knowledge around the data is often lacking. PubMed is a database comprising more than 21 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE and additional life science journals dating back to the 1950s. To explore the use and frequency of biomarkers across human disease, we mined PubMed for biomarker-disease associations. We then ranked the top 100 linked diseases by relevance and mapped them to medical subject headings (MeSH) and, subsequently, to the Disease Ontology. To identify biomarkers for each disease, we queried Covance BioPathways, an online data resource that maps commercial biomarker assays to biological and disease pathways. We then integrated pathways-based information to describe both known and potential biomarkers as well as disease-associated genes/proteins for select diseases. This approach identifies therapeutic areas with candidate or validated biomarkers, and highlights those areas where a paucity of biomarkers exists.</p>\n<p>Presented at the Molecular Med Tri-Con 2012, 21 February 2012</p>",

        "description": "<p>Python has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community in recent years resulting in a wide range of software being written for everything from numerical computation and machine learning to spectral analysis and visualization. SunPy is a free and open-source software library for working with solar and heliospheric datasets, written in the Python programming language. It provides an alternative to the IDL-based SolarSoft (SSW) solar data analysis environment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SunPy has map objects that allow simple overplotting of data from multiple two-dimensional image FITS files; time-series objects that allow overplotting of multiple lightcurves, and initial support for working with spectrogram data. SunPy provides integration with online services such as The Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), The Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and Helioviewer.org. SunPy also provides functionality that is not currently available in SSW such as advanced time series manipulation routines and support for working with solar data stored using JPEG 2000. We give some examples of what can be done in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can take advantage of many different data analysis tools not readily available in SSWIDL.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We also discuss future goals for the project and ways for interested users can become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.</p>\n<p><br>(Presented at SIPWork VI meeting in Bozeman, MT)</p>",

        "description": "<p>Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a type of vascular anomaly consisting of large intertwined vascular growth (the nidus) that are prone to serious hemorrhaging and can result in patient death if left untreated. Intervention through surgical clipping of feeding and draining vessels to the nidus is a common treatment. However, identification of which vessels to clip is challenging even to experienced surgeons aided by conventional image guidance systems. In this work, we describe our methods for processing static preoperative angiographic images in order to effectively visualize the feeding and draining vessels of an AVM nidus. This is one by processing the vessel images with level-set front propagation and using the resulting maps to label the vessels by colour and decluttering the image by vessel topological distances. In order to aid the surgeon in the vessel clipping decision-making process during surgery, the results are displayed to the surgeon using augmented virtuality.</p>",

National Park, 25-28 April 2012, Kudowa Zdrój, Poland</p>\n<p>Abstract:</p>\n<p>The systematic position of the Norway Spruce forest occurring in the highest parts of Szczeliniec Wielki and Szczeliniec Mały (theStołowe Mts., the Sudety Mts., Central Poland) is still unclear. The first attempts to determine its syntaxonomical position were presented in the papers of Szmajda (1979), Matuszkiewicz J., Matuszkiewicz M (1996) and Pender (1996). All above mentioned authors agreed, that this forest presents the impoverished form of <em>Calamagrostio villosae-Piceetum </em>(R. Tx. 1937) Hartm. ex Schluter 1966, which occurs here below the typical borders of mountain zone, due to specific climatic and ecological conditions. In 2011, using the standardized transect methods, we collected 54 phytosociological relevés from all sites in the Sudety Mts. on which the <em>Calamagrostio villosae-Piceetum </em>has been reported so far. It enabled us to compare the floristic compositions of the high mountain Norway spruce forests within their suggested range in the Sudety Mts. (the Karkonosze Mts., the Izery Mts., the Snieznik Massif, the Orlickie Mts., Wielka Sowa Mt.).</p>\n<p> </p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Tococa guianensis</em> is a Neotropical ant-plant associated with ants of the genus <em>Allomerus</em> and <em>Azteca</em>, which are effective in defending their host-plants against insect herbivores. However, near to the limit of its southern distribution, isolated <em>T. guianensis</em> populations were found to persist despite the local absence of <em>Allomerus</em> and <em>Azteca</em> (obligate ants). Several hypotheses were proposed to explain the long-term persistence of these populations: (1) opportunistic ants fulfill – at least partially – the role played by obligate ants; (2) leaf trichomes (whose density is greater in plants without obligate ants) prevent herbivory; or (3) herbivore pressure might be lower where obligate ants do not occur. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Time course DNA microarray experiments have become more prevalent in systems biology studies as they allow the investigation of transcriptome-wide changes over time. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a chemometrics technique, has recently been effectively applied to microarray time course data [1]. Successful application of MCR to time course microarray data requires some modifications to normal practices in both chemometrics and bioinformatics. These modifications concern issues of measurement quality, data transformation, and error estimation. As a consequence of analyzing a variety of DNA microarray time course studies, we have developed a set of standard workflow procedures that appear to be effective in extracting  the desired information and avoiding some of the pitfalls associated with this type of data. In this work we describe some of the aspects of these procedures with examples from relevant data sets.</p>",

This could be a valuable asset for the scientific community and release  data that is inaccessible to many scientists and patients. In the absence of mandates to free up data it may be possible to use crowdsourcing to deposit such small but important fragments of molecule related information into the public domain. We term this journal paywall busting.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Currently, SCID mice are the major biomedical model for the study of human cancer and other diseases; however, they can be a poor model because there is a large discrepancy in body size and physiology between rodents and humans. Since most new anticancer drugs are first evaluated in rodents, most fail in phase I and phase II clinical trials. Thus, there is a tremendous demand for more sophisticated animal models, which may improve the translation efficiency from preclinical to clinical studies. We recently identified pigs that are severely immunocompromised. Here we tested these pigs as a model for human tumors. Three immunodeficient (ID) pigs and three normal (WT) pigs, six weeks of age, were tested for their ability to allow xenotransplanted human tumors to grow. Each pig was transplanted with 4 million A375 human malignant melanoma cells subcutaneously into the left ear and 4 million PANC-1 human pancreatic carcinoma cells subcutaneously into the right ear on day 0. The ID pigs were euthanized 6, 14, or 23 days after cell transplantation, based on their health condition. Palpable melanoma tumors were identified on day 13 after cell transplantation in the two remaining ID pigs. After euthanasia, full necropsy was performed on all pigs; tissues were collected from ears and other organs for histopathological analysis. Melanoma and pancreatic tumor xenotransplants were identified histologically in all three ID pigs. The presence of human cancer cells in these pigs was further verified with anti-human mitochondrial immunohistochemistry. No transplanted tumors were found, grossly, histologically, or immunohistochemically, in the WT pigs. We propose that this genetic line of ID pigs may prove to be a useful large animal model for human tumors. <br> <em>:</em> </p>",

        "description": "<p>Deep brain stimulation of the ventral striatum is an effective treatment for a variety of treatment refractory psychiatric disorders yet the mechanism of action remains elusive. We examined how five days of stimulation affected rhythmic brain activity in freely moving rats in terms of oscillatory power within, and coherence between, selected limbic regions bilaterally. Custom made bipolar stimulating/recording electrodes were implanted, bilaterally, in the nucleus accumbens core. Local field potential (LFP) recording electrodes were implanted, bilaterally in the prelimbic and orbitofrontal cortices and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Stimulation was delivered bilaterally with 100 μs duration constant current pulses at a frequency of 130 Hz delivered at an amplitude of 100 μA using a custom-made stimulation device. Synchronized video and LFP data were collected from animals in their home cages before, during and after stimulation. Signals were processed to remove movement and stimulation artifacts, and analyzed to determine changes in spectral power within, and coherence between regions. Five days stimulation of the nucleus accumbens core yielded temporally dynamic modulation of LFP power in multiple bandwidths across multiple brain regions. Coherence was seen to decrease in the alpha band between the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and core of the nucleus accumbens. Coherence between each core of the nucleus accumbens bilaterally showed rich temporal dynamics throughout the five day stimulation period. Stimulation cessation revealed significant “rebound” effects in both power and coherence in multiple brain regions. Overall, the initial changes in power observed with short-term stimulation are replaced by altered coherence, which may reflect the functional action of DBS.</p>",
